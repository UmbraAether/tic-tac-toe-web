# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React and Vite. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking a cell with their respective symbols (X or O). The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## How to Play
1. The game starts with Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).
2. Players take turns to mark a cell on the 3x3 grid.
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row wins.
4. If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
